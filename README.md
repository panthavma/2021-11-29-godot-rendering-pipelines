# Godot Rendering Pipelines Example

This is an example project made for this article on my blog : <http://panthavma.com/articles/godot-rendering-pipelines/>


This illustrates :
- How to setup the node architecture (ExampleScene.tscn).
- What the shaders look like (PGBuffer-FirstPass.shader and PGBuffer-FullScreenPass.shader).
- How to do it through code (ExampleScene2-WithCode.tscn).
- How to make and use a previewer.


This method is also available in OddLib : <https://github.com/panthavma/oddlib>
